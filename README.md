# Zindi - Layer.ai Air Quality Prediction Challenge
Hello, this is my attempt to [this](https://zindi.africa/competitions/layerai-air-quality-prediction-challenge) competition hosted by [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/).

I have used the following things here:

* ANN build using Tensorflow
* Keras Tuner to fund the best hyper parameters

This strategy did not work well on the leadrborad but the take away here is that I learned a completely new technology.

## Installation
First create a new python virtual environment, activate that virtual environment and install the required packages

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Clean the data
Run the Jupyter notebook `clean_dataset.ipynb` to clean the dataset and split them into `train` and `valid` dataset.

## Develop the model
Run the Jupyter notebook `model_w_keras_tuner.ipynb` to train a model, generate submission file, and save the best model. This will do the following things:

1. train a model
2. predict on test dataset and generate submission csv file inside the `submissions` folder
3. save the best model in `best_model` folder
